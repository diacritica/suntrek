A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Mar 01-Mar 03 2013 is 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Mar 01-Mar 03 2013

            Mar 01     Mar 02     Mar 03
00-03UT        4          2          1     
03-06UT        4          2          1     
06-09UT        3          2          1     
09-12UT        5 (G1)     2          1     
12-15UT        4          2          2     
15-18UT        3          2          2     
18-21UT        3          2          2     
21-00UT        3          2          1     

Rationale: Continued unsettled to active conditions are expected on day
1 (01 Mar), with a chance for minor geomagnetic storming (NOAA Scale G1
(Minor)), due to a CH/HSS.  The geomagnetic field is expected to
decrease to primarily unsettled conditions for day 2 (02 Mar), and
return to quiet to unsettled conditions for day 3 (03 Mar), as CH/HSS
effects subside.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-13 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Mar 01-Mar 03 2013

              Mar 01  Mar 02  Mar 03
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Mar 01-Mar 03 2013

              Mar 01        Mar 02        Mar 03
R1-R2           15%           15%           15%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: Solar activity is likely to be low for the next three days
(01 - 03 Mar) with a slight chance for an M-class flare, with Region
1682 being the likely source.
