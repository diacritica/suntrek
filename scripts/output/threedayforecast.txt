A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Apr 12-Apr 14 2013 is 6 (NOAA Scale
G2).

21-00UT        1          6 (G2)     3     

Rationale: G1 (minor) to G2 (moderate) geomagnetic storms are expected
on days 2 and 3 (13-14 Apr) in response to a CME from 11 Apr.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-13 over the past 24 hours, was
above S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Apr 12-Apr 14 2013

              Apr 12  Apr 13  Apr 14
S1 or greater   99%     30%     10%

Rationale: An S1 (Minor) solar radiation storms is expected on day 1 (12
Apr).  There is a chance for an S1 event on day 2 (13 Apr).

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Apr 12-Apr 14 2013

              Apr 12        Apr 13        Apr 14
R1-R2           50%           50%           50%
R3 or greater   15%           15%           15%

Rationale: There is a chance for an R1-R2 radio blackout all three days
(12-14 Apr) of the forecast period.
