A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 2 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 28-Mar 02 2013 is 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected on day one (28
Feb).  Field activity is expected to increase to quiet to unsettled
levels on day two (01 Mar), with a slight chance for G1 (Minor) storms,
due to the onset of a coronal hole high-speed stream (CH HSS).  Activity
is expected to return to quiet levels on day three (02 Mar), with a
chance for unsettled levels, as CH HSS effects subside.

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-13 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 28-Mar 02 2013

              Feb 28  Mar 01  Mar 02
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 28-Mar 02 2013

              Feb 28        Mar 01        Mar 02
R1-R2           10%           10%           10%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio
blackouts during the forecast period, due primarily to the flare
potential in Region 1682.
