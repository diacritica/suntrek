A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 1 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 10-Feb 12 2013 is 3 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

21-00UT        1          1          2     

Rationale: Quiet levels (Kp 1-2) are expected on days 1-2 (10-11 Feb). 
On day 3 (12 Feb), an increase to quiet to unsettled levels (Kp 1-3) is
expected due to the passage of the 09 February CME.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-13 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 10-Feb 12 2013

              Feb 10  Feb 11  Feb 12
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

No radio blackouts were observed over the past 24 hours.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 10-Feb 12 2013

              Feb 10        Feb 11        Feb 12
R1-R2           10%           10%           10%
R3 or greater    1%            1%            1%

Rationale: A slight chance exists for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio
blackouts for the forecast period (10-12 Feb).
